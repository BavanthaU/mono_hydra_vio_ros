- Launch files for RealSense D435i, ZED-X mono/RGB-D, and uHumans2 datasets.
- CMake integration with the SuperPoint/ONNX Runtime support introduced in the
  `mono_hydra_vio` core fork.
- Updated RViz configs and logging paths aligned with the Mono-Hydra workflow.

## How to use this fork

1. Clone the curated workspace using the script provided in the
   [`mono_hydra`](https://github.com/UAV-Centre-ITC/Mono_Hydra) repository. The
   script pulls `mono_hydra_vio_ros`, `mono_hydra_vio`, and all dependencies at
   known-good commits.
2. Build the catkin workspace (`catkin build`).
3. Launch one of the dataset-specific bring-up files, e.g.
   `roslaunch mono_hydra_vio_ros kimera_vio_ros_realsense_rgbd.launch`.
